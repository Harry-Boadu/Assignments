      Swimming is an individual or team racing sport that requires the use of
      one's entire body to move through water. The sport takes place in pools or
      open water (e.g., in a sea or lake). Competitive swimming is one of the
      most popular Olympic sports,[1] with varied distance events in butterfly,
      backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and individual medley. In addition to
      these individual events, four swimmers can take part in either a freestyle
      or medley relay. A medley relay consists of four swimmers who will each
      swim a different stroke, ordered as backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly
      and freestyle.[2] Swimming each stroke requires a set of specific
      techniques; in competition, there are distinct regulations concerning the
      acceptable form for each individual stroke.[3] There are also regulations
      on what types of swimsuits, caps, jewelry and injury tape that are allowed
      at competitions.[4] Although it is possible for competitive swimmers to
      incur several injuries from the sport, such as tendinitis in the shoulders
      or knees, there are also multiple health benefits associated with the
      sport.
